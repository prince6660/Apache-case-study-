The Apache HTTP Server, commonly referred to as Apache, is an open-source web server software.
It's known for its robustness, security, and modularity. 
As of my last knowledge update in September 2021.
Apache consistently held the largest market share among web servers.
powering a significant portion of websites on the internet.
Case Study: Wikimedia Foundation (Wikipedia)Overview: The Wikimedia Foundation, a non-profit organization,
operates some of the world's largest collaborative projects, including Wikipedia, a free online encyclopedia with millions of articles.
Wikipedia relies heavily on Apache for its web server needs.Challenges:Scalability: Wikipedia receives a massive number of visitors daily
. It needed a web server solution that could handle this level of traffic while maintaining stability and performance.
Security: As a platform that provides information to millions, security is paramount.
The Wikimedia Foundation needed a web server that could defend against various types of attacks and vulnerabilities.
Customizability: Wikipedia's infrastructure required specific configurations and modules to support its unique needs,
which necessitated a web server that was highly customizable.
Solution: The Wikimedia Foundation chose to deploy Apache HTTP Server to manage their web services.
Implementation:Scalability: Apache's modular architecture allowed for easy scaling by adding more servers to distribute the load.
Techniques like load balancing and caching were employed to further enhance performance.
Security: Apache has a strong track record in terms of security. Regular updates and patches were applied to mitigate vulnerabilities. Additionally, the use of security modules and best practices helped safeguard the servers.Customizability: Apache's extensive module system allowed Wikimedia to customize the server to their exact requirements. They could add or remove modules as needed to optimize performance and functionality.Results:Reliability: The use of Apache contributed significantly to Wikipedia's uptime and availability, ensuring users could access information reliably.Scalability: With Apache's help, Wikipedia was able to handle a vast number of users and page views every day, even during traffic spikes.Security: By following best practices and leveraging Apache's security features, the Wikimedia Foundation successfully defended against numerous potential security threats.Case Study: Wikimedia Foundation (Wikipedia)Overview: The Wikimedia Foundation, a non-profit organization, operates some of the world's largest collaborative projects, including Wikipedia, a free online encyclopedia with millions of articles.
